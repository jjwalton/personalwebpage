# Notes

* [Algebraic topology notes](../maths_notes/AT.pdf) for masters level course taught at Durham University, Michaelmas term of 2017--18. They're rather slow paced and overly wordy, so I also made a distilled version --- several students told me that they appreciated the extra detail though.
* [Minicourse notes](../maths_notes/Top_Ap_Lecture_Summary.pdf), for three day mini-course *topological methods in aperiodicity*, lectured in Vienna 7th--9th June 2017. These were meant to supplement the lectures, so a lot of details are missing, but most of it should still make sense independently.
* [K-theory notes](../maths_notes/Introduction_to_K-theory.pdf), a very brief (proofless) introduction to K-theory for C*-algebras, accompanying 1hr talk in the Glasgow Analysis Working Seminar.
* [Characteristic classes notes](../maths_notes/Characteristic_classes.pdf), an introduction to characteristic classes (mostly the Chern classes). These were reference notes for material I talked on over 2 lectures in the Glasgow Analysis Working Seminar.
