I am a Teaching Associate in the [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/mathematics/) at the University of Nottingham. I previously held positions at the [University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/maths/), [Durham University](https://www.dur.ac.uk/mathematical.sciences/) and the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/). I obtained my Ph.D. from the [University of Leicester](https://le.ac.uk/mathematics) under the supervision of [Prof. John Hunton](https://www.dur.ac.uk/research/directory/staff/?mode=staff&id=11887) and [Prof. Alex Clark](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/maths/profiles/clarkalex.html).

I love teaching Mathematics, which is the focus of my work in Nottingham. My mathematical interests are in the field of [Aperiodic Order](https://www.ams.org/publications/journals/notices/201606/rnoti-p647.pdf), particularly of invariants of aperiodic patterns defined via tools from Algebraic Topology and Dynamical Systems. I am also interested in properties of cut and project sets, especially as a bridge between their geometric recurrence properties and the field of Diophantine Approximation, a branch of Number Theory which concerns how well rational numbers can approximate real numbers.

I was previously an organiser of the [Glasgow Anaylsis Seminar](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/events/archive/?seriesID=5). With [Dan Rust](http://www.open.ac.uk/people/dr8563), I organised the 2018 [Model Sets and Aperiodic Order Conference](https://sites.google.com/view/modelsets). I am a member of the [London Mathematical Society](https://www.lms.ac.uk/). With [Henna Koivusalo](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/henna-l-l-koivusalo) I will be organising a special session on Tiling Spaces at the [36th Summer Topology Conference](https://www.univie.ac.at/projektservice-mathematik/e/index.php?event=stc21) at the University of Vienna, July 2021 (update: due to COVID-19 this event has now been cancelled, although we hope to hold it in 2022).
