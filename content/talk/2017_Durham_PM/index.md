title: Aperiodic order, number theory and topology
event: Pure Maths Colloquium
event_url: https://www.dur.ac.uk/mathematical.sciences/events/seminars/seminararchives/?seminar=5010
location: Durham University, United Kingdom
summary: ""
abstract: "
In this talk I shall introduce the field of aperiodic order, a branch of geometry which aims to study infinite patterns which display a great amount of structural order, despite lacking translational symmetry, i.e., without \"repeating themselves\". These intriguing patterns make for instructive models of \"quasicrystals\", amongst other physical applications, but I shall show how they also arise in areas of pure mathematics. In particular, the properties of a special class of these patterns, called cut-and-project sets, are intimately linked with questions in Diophantine approximation, the area of number theory which investigates quantitatively how rational numbers approximate real numbers. As time permits, I shall also explain the approach to studying aperiodic patterns through topology, via associated moduli spaces of patterns.
