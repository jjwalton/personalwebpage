Our results cover those cut and project schemes for which the lattice projects densely into the internal space and (possibly after translation) hits each supporting hyperplane of the polytopal window. Our main result is that LR is satisfied if and only if the patterns are of low complexity (property C), and the projected lattice satisfies a Diophantine condition (property D). Property C can be checked by computation of the ranks and dimensions of linear spans of the stabiliser subgroups of the supporting hyperplanes, as investigated in Part I to this article. To define the correct Diophantine condition D, we establish new results on decomposing polytopal cut and project schemes to factors, developing concepts initiated in the work of Forrest, Hunton and Kellendonk. This means that, when C is satisfied, the window splits into components which induce a compatible splitting of the lattice. Then property D is the requirement that, for any suitable decomposition, these factors do not project close to the origin in the internal space, relative to the norm in the total space. On each factor, this corresponds to the usual notion from Diophantine Approximation of a system of linear forms being badly approximable. This extends previous work on cubical cut and project schemes to a very general class of cut and project schemes. We demonstrate our main theorem on several examples, and derive some further consequences of our main theorem, such as the equivalence LR, positivity of weights and satisfying a subadditive ergodic theorem for this class of polytopal cut and project sets.

Instead of studying infinite strings of symbols, one may also assign each symbol a length, for example. In higher dimensions one considers infinite point patterns, or tilings by tiles of a variety of shapes. The analogue of a shift of finite type for tilings is a set of tiles with rules on their relative placements in a valid tiling. One of the most enticing questions in this area is the Monotile Problem: is there a single shape of tile in the plane whose rigid motions may tile the plane, but only non-periodically? Taylor and Socolar gave a satisfying answer to this question with a certain marked hexagonal tile, although to enforce aperiodicity restrictions are needed for neighbours as well as next nearest neighbours of tiles, or alternatively a tile with disconnected interior must be used. I will give an introductory overview of the field of Aperiodic Order through examples, explaining the main constructions of interesting non-periodic patterns. I will then explain recent work with Mike Whittaker on a single aperiodic tile in the plane with edge-to-edge matching rules. Unfortunately these rules cannot be enforced by shape alone, since only symbols in certain orientations enforce matching restrictions.

To study this rotational structure topologically, we consider instead a more complicated space, the rotational hull of the pattern, denoted ${\\Omega\\_{r}}$.

In one dimension, prototypical mathematical models for quasicrystals are provided by Sturmian sequences and by point sets generated by substitution rules. Regularity properties of such sets are well understood, thanks mostly to well known results by Morse and Hedlund, and physicists have used this understanding to study one dimensional random Schrödinger operators and lattice gas models. A key fact which plays an important role in these problems is the existence of a subadditive ergodic theorem, which is guaranteed when the corresponding point set is linearly repetitive. In this paper we extend the one-dimensional model to cut and project sets, which generalize Sturmian sequences in higher dimensions, and which are frequently used in mathematical and physical literature as models for higher dimensional quasicrystals. By using a combination of algebraic, geometric, and dynamical techniques, together with input from higher dimensional Diophantine approximation, we give a complete characterization of all linearly repetitive cut and project sets with cubical windows. We also prove that these are precisely the collection of such sets which satisfy subadditive ergodic theorems. The results are explicit enough to allow us to apply them to known classical models, and to construct linearly repetitive cut and project sets in all pairs of dimensions and codimensions in which they exist.","tags":null,"title":"A characterization of linearly repetitive cut and project sets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alan Haynes","Henna Koivusalo","James Walton"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"d9cc7cee8c844c4c35c24477d125cea0","permalink":"/publication/2018hkw_b/","publishdate":"2019-06-18T21:50:45.632915Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018hkw_b/","section":"publication","summary":"Linearly repetitive cut and project sets are mathematical models for perfectly ordered quasicrystals.

This means that they can be described from just a fundamental domain and their symmetry group. An aperiodically ordered pattern is one which can frequently repeat itself on finite patches but without being globally periodic. These are far more complicated to analyse and a variety of abstract tools has been developed to understand them. In this talk I shall explain how one studies them topologically, via associated moduli spaces of locally indistinguishable patterns. Topological invariants are applied, such as K-theory or Cech cohomology. I shall briefly outline how one goes about computing these invariants and how one may visualise what they say about the original pattern. At present most attention is dedicated to studying these patterns translationally. Bringing in rotations introduces some interesting challenges; a 3-dimensional periodic pattern, for example, has associated translational moduli space simply the 3-torus, but the rotational version is a 6-manifold whose topology depends crucially on the rotational symmetries of the pattern.
